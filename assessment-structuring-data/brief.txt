you want to provide an easy-to-follow set of data to look up facts and figures about the planets. an HTML data table would be ideal - you need to take the raw data you have available and turn it into a table.

### steps to complete ###

 [] open a copy of blank-template.html, and start the table off by giving it an outer container, a table header, and table body. you don't need a table footer for this example

 [] add the provided caption to your table

 [] add a row to the table header containing all the column headers

 [] create all the content rows inside the table body, remembering to make all the row headings into headings semantically

 [] ensure all the content is placed into the right cells - in the raw data, each row of planet data is shown next to its associated planet

 [] add attributes to make the row and column headers unambiguously associated with the rows, columns, or rowgroups that they act as headings for

 [] add a black border just around the column that contains all the planet name row headers
